# DIPLOMA
As part of the graduation project, there was made a thyristor converter with a digital control system.

It was decided to use two microcontrollers. Programs for the Atmel Atmega 32 microcontrollers written in the ICC7 for AVR environment

Microcontroller No. 1 implements the functions of a thyristor converter directly (digital controllers + Pulse-phase control system + overcurrent protection) - SIFU program

Microcontroller No. 2 is responsible for receiving service data and "communicating" with the liquid crystal indicator. Both microcontrollers communicate via the UART interface - INDIC prog

A control system has been developed: a Pulse-phase control system program has been written, a control circuit has been designed, a control board has been made. A clear and simple input / output of system parameters was implemented, an indication circuit was designed for this, a program was written.
After the thyristor converter was assembled, the digital controllers were adjusted. An analysis was made of the influence of the discreteness of the digital system.
In the research part of the project, studies of the DC electric drive were carried out, static and dynamic characteristics were built.
